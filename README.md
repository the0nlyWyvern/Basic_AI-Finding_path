# PATH FINDING (ft. Python)

# Description

- A small project using Python in _Introduction to Artificial Intelligence_ class.
- Solving mazes and achieving the highest point.
- Goal: Evaluate pros and cons of each algorithms, how it works in different mazes.

# Table of contents

Non heuristic searching algorithms:

- Depth-first search (DFS)
- Breadth-first search (BFS)

Heuristic searching algorithms:

- Greedy Best-first search
- A\* (best-first search algorithm)

# How to use

- We use the main.py to manage the programs

# Going into details

- For more details, I put a README.md (unfinished) file in **./goingIntoDetails** folder.
- You can use **./goingIntoDetails/[vietnamese]report.docx** file, I will translate this file in the future.
