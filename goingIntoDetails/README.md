## Basic techniques

###### Backtracking

- Inspired by Greek mythology, the hero Theseus entered the labyrinth, defeated the _half-human, half-bull_ Minotaur and returned with the thread left earlier. But how can he got out?
- Theseus was given a _ball of thread_, one end of which he attached to the entrance of the Labyrinth. After killing the Minotaur, he wound the thread back up to find his way out.
- This is the idea of **backtracking pointer**, which keeps track of the parent pointer, tracing each of these pointers will help us go back to the starting point. And this is also the solution of that labyrinth.
